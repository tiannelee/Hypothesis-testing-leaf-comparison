# Statistical hypothesis testing: Leaf Comparison

This is a group project by Tianne Lee, Steven Tsai, Chloe Zhang, and Jinghan Xu for UBC's STAT 201 course.

In this project, we used R to perform EDA on the data and conducted statistical inference using the `infer` package to answer the following question: is the mean smoothness and solidity of Tilia tomentosa larger than Betula pubescens?
